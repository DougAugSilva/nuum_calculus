# Numerical Calculus Library in C

## Repository objectives
With this repository I want to put into practice my studies in numerical calculus and the C programming language. The repository contains several numerical methods to approximate functions values such as Newtons method, or methods to solve numerical problems, such as find the best splines to approximate a function, with quadratic and cubic splines.

## How use this repository
To use this repository you just need to compile the code with the function in they respective aquiver, and and call those files as libraries of C.
You will also need to have Gnuplot installed to plot the graphs in the `interpolation.c` test file. To install it on Linux, run `sudo apt update && sudo apt install gnuplot -y`.
I use *Linux* and *GCC* to compile the code during the development and test. To compile the code on your native Linux machine (or on Windows WSL, if you prefer) and run the test files created to demonstrate the use of each function, execute the following scripts.:
- `gcc -Iinclude src/roots.c tests/roots_test.c -o bin/roots_test -lm && ./bin/roots_test`
- `gcc -Iinclude src/systems.c tests/systems_test.c -o bin/systems_test -lm && ./bin/systems_test`
- `.`

## Mathematical content of this repository
I choose not to focus too much deep in the mathematical rigorous theory in this repository, in the meaning that there is not proofs or explanation of the methods, just some comments in the code to help he readers to understand some "obscure mathematical tricks".
The topics covers in numerical analysis are the same as the ones I studied in my mathematical bachelor degree in 2025, and I enjoyed thanking my college professor at State University of Londrina Dr. ALine Aparecida de Souza Leão.
